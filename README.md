# 08-Update Portfolio

This is a starter portfolio that I will add to as the course progresses. 
An effective portfolio highlights your strongest work as well as the thought processes behind it. This portfolio will include flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables.

## Instructions

Here is the current user story: 

* As an employer, I want to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples so that I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when you load the portfolio the person is presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them.

* It's done when you click one of the links in the navigation and the UI scrolls to the corresponding section.

* It's done when you click on the link to the section about their work and the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications.

* It's done when you are presented with the developer's first application and that application's image should be larger in size than the others.

* It's done when you click on the images of the applications and I am taken to that deployed application.

* It's done when you resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices, you are presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport.
