# 16-Update Portfolio

This is a starter portfolio that I will add to as the course progresses. 
An effective portfolio highlights your strongest work as well as the thought processes behind it. This portfolio will include flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables.

## Instructions

Here is the current user story: 

* As an employer, I want to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples so that I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position.

## Acceptance Criteria

* Your updated portfolio should:

* Display your contact information. If you don't want to share your personal email or phone number, use a separate email that you will only use for coding, also known as a developer email, and/or a call forwarding service, such as Google Voice.

* Have links to your GitHub profile and LinkedIn profile

* Have a link to a downloadable PDF of your resume

* Display at least 3 examples of student work from either deployed projects or homeworks. For each project, make sure you have the following: Project title, Link to the deployed version, Link to the GitHub repository, Screenshot of the deployed application, Have a polished, mobile-responsive user interface.
